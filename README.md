# password-generator

## Description

This is a password generator. It was built with some starter code, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

It will:

- take user input about the desired length (between 8 and 128 characters) of the random password
- ask the user to choose if they want numbers, symbols, lowercase letters, or uppercase letters in their password
- return two separate alerts if the user decides to generate a password outside these specifications
- provide the user with a random password

Through making the password generator I :

- gained experience with JavaScript "prompt", "confirm", and "alert"
- used "addEventListener" to connect an HTML element with JavaScript
- wrote a set of "if statements" to fill an empty array
- created a "for loop" to select the random password
